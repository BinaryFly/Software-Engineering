# Introduction

This is the course descriptor for the Software Engineering course.

Software engineering 1 covers functors and monads, which are advanced patterns used to structure code in a composable way to solve a variety of problems in query-management, UI rendering, parallel processing, and more. The focus of the course will be on the patterns, and not on a pervasive philosophy of functional programming. These patterns are used in the practice of modern mainstream programming languages, from C# and Java to the JavaScript world. For this reason, we will build examples in TypeScript, a modern popular statically-typed variant of JavaScript with both a rich type system and broad appeal for professionals.

Thanks to this course, students will understand advanced patterns and the important principle of composition at a higher level of abstraction.
