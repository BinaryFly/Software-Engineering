# Introduction

This is the course descriptor for the Software Engineering course.

Software engineering 1 covers functors and monads, which are advanced patterns used to structure code in a composable way to solve a variety of problems in query-management, UI rendering, parallel processing, and more. The focus of the course will be on the patterns, and not on a pervasive philosophy of functional programming. These patterns are used in the practice of modern mainstream programming languages, from C# and Java to the JavaScript world. For this reason, we will build examples in TypeScript, a modern popular statically-typed variant of JavaScript with both a rich type system and broad appeal for professionals.

Thanks to this course, students will understand advanced patterns and the important principle of composition at a higher level of abstraction.

# Learning Goals

The course has the following learning goals:

- (ICODE) students can recognize and formally interpret important properties of abstract patterns such as associativity, preservation of identity, or homomorphism;
- (WCODE) students can write small snippets of code in order to complete the implementation of a known abstract pattern.
  The course, and therefore also the learning goals, are limited to **referentially transparent**, **type-safe** programs written in TypeScript.

The corresponding competences connected to these learning goals are:

- realisation.

# Learning Materials

The mandatory learning materials are:

- reader of the lectures, which will be made available one week after the lecture
- materials on the Github repository (github.com/hogeschool), which is already online
